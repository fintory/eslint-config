**Disclaimer:** This monorepo was mostly copied from eslint-config-airbnb, which is a huge inspiration in creating our own configuration. We want to develop the configuration to our own code-style over time, hence we copied everything.
The only problem we saw with the eslint-config-airbnb extension, is that we are constantly advised in installing **a lot** of dependencies.

The monorepo was created for managing the eslint configuration for both, typescript and non-typescript projects we are developing at @fintory. This is the base repository for our clients projects, which basically extend the configuration on it's own, and then configure the configuration on it's own.
